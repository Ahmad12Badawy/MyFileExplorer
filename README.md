# MyFileExplorer
create Qt 5 GUI interface for file explorer. list separately different types of files under a chosen directory and give the ability to preview these files.
I faced some difficulties trying to play media files using videoWidget inside the mainWindow specifically .mp4 and some .mp3 files so I decided to preview these files outside my program and to use the default win7 programs to run these files. Only pictures are viewed inside the mainWindow.
This project is Qt 5.8 project, tested under Win7 x64 machine.
